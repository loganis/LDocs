## About this guide

This guide provides a brief top level introduction to Loganis:

* User levels
* Glossary
* Interfaces

## User levels

There are many different Users who may find Loganis useful.

* The following grouping of Loganis users is just a simplified overview of the possible different levels.
  * Reading reports
  * Installing Dashboard Templates
  * Editing installed queries
  * Writing your own queries
  * Assembling queries into dashboards
  * Developing applications using API

### Reading reports

Reading reports in order to gain insights.

* Dashboards are collection of [interactive charts](/assets/javascripts/diff.html)

  * ![pic1](/assets/images/viewdash.jpg "Dashboard")

### Installing Dashboard Templates

Installing a Dashboard template requrires an already added Channel.

* Select a Template on the Project page from

  * ![pic1](/assets/images/dtemp.jpg "Install a Dashboard Template")

### Editing installed queries

Edit an installed query to change date period from `last_31_days` to `last_2_months`

  * ![pic1](/assets/images/cinstalled.jpg "Select a Query to edit")
  * You may read [LQuery Overview](/articles/lquery_overview.html) for more options
  * Examine installed queries to learn LQuery by example

### Writing your own queries

Writing LQuery fluently requires some learning but you do not have to be a programmer to write LQuery.

* LQuery is a declarative statement that can contain
  * `:met` Metric names to grab
  * `:dim` Dimension names to group by
  * `:per` or `:beg` `:end` Date period
  * `:ord` Sort ordering
  * `:fil` Filter data
  * `:seg` Segment data
  * `:max` Maximize the number of rows returned from GA or FB
  * `:lim` Limit the number of rows in the result
  * `:fun` Function definition for additional processing
* Read more on [LQuery Overview](/articles/lquery_overview.html)
* You should have an average understanding of [GA metrics and dimesnions](/articles/guides.html#ga_dimensions_and_metrics_overview)
* You should be an Analytics Expert to know what it is all about.

### Assembling queries into dashboards

Queries are independent from each other but they can be assembled into more complex form.

* `:joi` Join tag allows you to merge the results of 2 or more queries into a merged one by a dimension.
* `:dsh` Dashboard tag allows you to assemble the result of 2 or more queries into a complex dashboard.

### Developing applications using API

There is an API for Loganis so queries can be requested from any REST API capable application.

* [LSheet](https://github.com/loganis/LSheet) is an example Excel VBA application
  * ![pic1](/assets/images/vba.png "Excel VBA")
* [spm-lqs](https://github.com/loganis/spm-lqs) is an example Scatter Plot Matrix application in Clojure
  * ![pic1](/assets/images/spm1.png "Scatter Plot Matrix")
* [LCurl](https://github.com/loganis/LCurl) is a command line shell utility example using curl

``` bash
lqs ~/.my-token samples/query-csv-gzip
"date","ch0:ga:sessions"
"2014-03-31",49
"2014-04-01",39
"2014-04-02",38
"2014-04-03",31
"2014-04-04",18
"2014-04-05",9
```

* Summary of Loganis API
  * `Token`: genrate a developer token for your Loganis Account
  * `Query`: write a query
  * Execute: HTTP POST `Token` and `Query` to Loganis API

## Glossary

  * ![pic1](/assets/images/lprojectlist.png "Project List")
  * Channels
* API Token can be generated by User

### Channel

* Channel is a collection of GA or FB profiles
* Profile data can be accessed by using channel name
* ch0, ch1, ch2 etc. Channel name scheme enables anonymisation of data
  * `:met "ch0:ga:sessions,ch1:ga:sessions"`
  * `ga:sessions` metric from `ch0` and `ch1` channel

### Project

* Project is a collection of Queries
* Used as a Project Folder or Directory to store LQuery items

### Query

* Query is a declarative statement
  * [LQuery Overview](/articles/lquery_overview.html)
* A Query can be a
  * `Chart` default query with/without Chart options:
    * ![pic1](/assets/images/lquery.png "LQuery")
    * Google `Charts API` options:
